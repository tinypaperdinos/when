# `components/ui/`

Generic, reusable, presentational components — buttons, inputs, the date-time picker,
tags, layout primitives, etc. Not feature/page components (those live under
`src/routes/`).

## Conventions

- **Filenames**: kebab-case (e.g. `button.tsx`).
- **Exports**: PascalCase named export matching the component (e.g. `button.tsx` exports
  `Button`). Matches the `src/routes/` convention already used in this repo.
- **Tests**: every component gets a colocated `*.test.tsx` (e.g. `button.test.tsx`),
  Vitest + Testing Library, matching the pattern in `src/routes/tasks-page.test.tsx`.
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes. `src/index.css` defines the base visual design
  language — extend it further only when a component/feature ticket actually needs a new
  token (see `AGENT_RULES.md`), not speculatively. The established language:
  - **Font**: JetBrains Mono (self-hosted via `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono`), set as the
    default body font — don't add `font-mono` per component, it's already the baseline.
  - **Palette**: muted, not bright — theme tokens `ink` (near-black text), `paper`
    (off-white background), `line` (neutral border/divider), `accent` (+ `accent-dark`,
    muted teal-blue, primary interactive color), `pop` (muted rust, used for tags/labels
    that need to stand out from `accent`).
  - **No Material-style elevation**: components are border-first (`border-2 border-ink`
    is the norm, not a soft `box-shadow`). Depth comes from a hard, non-blurred offset
    shadow (`shadow-[3px_3px_0_0_#1e1d1b]`), not a blurred elevation shadow.
  - **Press feedback**: on `active`, translate the element by the same offset as its
    shadow and drop the shadow instantly (`active:translate-x-[3px] active:translate-y-[3px]
    active:shadow-none`) — see `button.tsx`. Don't transition `box-shadow` itself; a
    `var()`-referenced shadow color doesn't interpolate cleanly during a transition and
    produces a visible lag. Only `transform` should be in the `transition-*` property list.
  - **Focus**: dashed outline (`focus-visible:outline-dashed focus-visible:outline-2
    focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-accent`), not Tailwind's default
    soft `ring`.
  - **Corners**: slightly rounded (`rounded-sm`), not Material's heavier rounding and not
    fully square.
  - A fuller interactive exploration (loading spinner, a circular "complete" checkbox
    with a spring-pop + confirm ring, tag chip variants) lives in the unmerged
    `explore/page-design` reference branch — pull patterns from there as the tickets that
    need them come up, rather than re-deciding from scratch.
- **Demo route**: every component here must be added to the demo page
  (`src/routes/ui-demo-page.tsx`) so it stays visible for visual review at `/dev/ui`
  (dev server only). This is manual registration, not auto-discovery — when you add a
  new component, add a section for it in `ui-demo-page.tsx` showing its variants/sizes.

## Extending an existing component vs. adding a new one

If a later ticket needs a new variant of a component that already exists here (e.g. an
`icon` variant of `Button`), extend the existing file in place — don't create a
duplicate or rebuild it from scratch. See the note at the top of `button.tsx` for a
concrete example.
